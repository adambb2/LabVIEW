# LabVIEW
This repository contains assignments I have done using LabVIEW. A timed in class assignment was done where I had to create a simulation of Heating control in a winter time home. Temperature constantly decreases over time unless at least one heater is on. The turn on to regulate the temperature within a comfortable range. The additional heater kicks on if there is large temperature difference, but the user can control whether it is ON or OFF if energy needs to be conserved. This programming project required an understanding of shift registers, state machines, and case structures.
